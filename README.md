extremely-simple-css3-tooltip
=============================

An extremely simple CSS3 tooltip solution which is supported by browsers that understand `attr()`.
No Javascript is being used. Written in little over 20 lines of CSS (can be even shorter depending on style).

You simply wrap your word or phrase using a `<span>` tag and set the `data-tooltip` attribute, like so:

    This is a paragraph that contains <span data-tooltip="Text is usually a collection of words">text</span> and other bits and bobs.

CSS takes care of the rest.
